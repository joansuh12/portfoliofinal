				<p>“I’m sure it’s about time. Just hearing different stories, I think it’s very nice to understand each other. And we should embrace each other. People are categorised like black, white, yellow, brown … that is not a nice way to just divide like that, you know? I think we should put our colours together, make it prettier, even rainbows have seven colours. Colours don’t matter,” <br> - Youn Yuh Jung </p>
